## Hi I'm Christian

Hi! I am a passionate junior web developer with a strong interest in creating intuitive and functional user experiences. I have experience in developing websites using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and libraries such as Vue.js. I am skilled in implementing responsive and optimized designs for various devices, and I enjoy working in collaborative teams to solve complex problems. Currently, I am deepening my knowledge in backend development with PHP, Laravel and MySQL. I am always looking for new challenges to improve my skills and contribute to innovative projects.
